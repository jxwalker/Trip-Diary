# 🔧 API Route Fix - WRONG SERVICE USED!

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

The guide generation was producing garbage content because the system was calling the **wrong service**! It was using the **FastGuideService** (which we stripped of all content) instead of the **EnhancedGuideService** (which has rich, comprehensive content).

---

## 🎯 **What Was Wrong**

### **Root Cause:**
The system was using the **FastGuideService** which we had stripped of all fallback content, leaving it with minimal/error-only responses.

### **Evidence:**
```python
# In main.py line 567:
guide_service = FastGuideService()  # ← WRONG SERVICE!

# Method call:
guide_service.generate_fast_guide(...)  # ← Minimal content method
```

### **Why This Happened:**
1. **FastGuideService** was originally designed for "fast" generation (10-20 seconds)
2. We stripped it of all fallback content to prevent placeholder data
3. **EnhancedGuideService** was available but not being used
4. The system was calling the wrong service entirely

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Service Switch:**
```python
# BEFORE (wrong service):
guide_service = FastGuideService()
enhanced_guide = await guide_service.generate_fast_guide(...)

# AFTER (correct service):
guide_service = EnhancedGuideService()
enhanced_guide = await guide_service.generate_enhanced_guide(...)
```

### **Method Signature Update:**
```python
# EnhancedGuideService requires additional parameters:
enhanced_guide = await guide_service.generate_enhanced_guide(
    destination=destination,
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date,
    hotel_info=hotel_info,
    preferences=preferences,
    extracted_data=trip_data_obj.extracted_data or {},  # ← Added
    progress_callback=enhanced_progress_callback,
    single_pass=True  # ← Added for faster generation
)
```

### **Timeout Adjustment:**
```python
# Increased timeout for comprehensive guide generation:
timeout=90  # 90 seconds instead of 50 for rich content
```
