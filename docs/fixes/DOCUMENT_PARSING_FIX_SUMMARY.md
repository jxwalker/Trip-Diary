# 🔧 Document Parsing Fix - RESOLVED!

## ✅ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

Successfully fixed the document parsing issue that was preventing test trip documents from being parsed correctly. The LLMExtractor was failing to load API keys due to incorrect .env file path, causing it to fall back to basic pattern matching.

---

## 🎯 **What Was Wrong**

### **Root Cause:**
The `LLMExtractor` was looking for the `.env` file in the wrong location:

```python
# WRONG - Looking in backend directory:
backend_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent
env_path = backend_dir / ".env"  # travel-pack/backend/.env (doesn't exist)
```

### **Symptoms:**
- ❌ **LLM extraction failing** and falling back to basic pattern matching
- ❌ **Poor parsing results** with duplicate/incomplete data
- ❌ **Missing hotel information** 
- ❌ **Incorrect flight details**
- ❌ **No passenger information**

### **Evidence:**
```json
{
  "flights": [
    {"flight_number": "AF011", "airline": "AF"},
    {"flight_number": "DL263", "airline": "DL"},
    {"flight_number": "AF011", "airline": "AF"},  // Duplicates!
    {"flight_number": "DL263", "airline": "DL"}
  ],
  "hotels": [],  // Empty!
  "error": "LLM extraction failed, using basic pattern matching"
}
```

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Corrected .env File Path:**
```python
# FIXED - Looking in project root:
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent
env_path = project_root / ".env"  # /home/james/code/trip-diary/.env (exists!)
```

### **Path Resolution:**
```
Before: travel-pack/backend/services/llm_extractor.py
        └── ../..                    (travel-pack/backend/)
        └── .env                     ❌ File not found

After:  travel-pack/backend/services/llm_extractor.py  
        └── ../../../..              (project root)
        └── .env                     ✅ File found
```

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **Upload Test Documents:**
1. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   cd travel-pack/backend && python main.py
   cd travel-pack/app && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Upload test files:**
   - `travel-pack/backend/tests/fixtures/paris_trip.txt`
   - `travel-pack/backend/tests/fixtures/london_trip.txt`
   - `travel-pack/backend/tests/fixtures/tokyo_trip.txt`

3. **Verify parsing:**
   - Check extracted flights, hotels, and passengers
   - Ensure no "LLM extraction failed" errors
   - Confirm all details are captured correctly

### **Direct Testing:**
```bash
cd travel-pack/backend
python -c "
import asyncio
from services.llm_extractor import LLMExtractor

async def test():
    with open('tests/fixtures/paris_trip.txt', 'r') as f:
        text = f.read()
    
    extractor = LLMExtractor()
    result = await extractor.extract_travel_info(text)
    
    print(f'Flights: {len(result.get(\"flights\", []))}')
    print(f'Hotels: {len(result.get(\"hotels\", []))}')
    print(f'Error: {result.get(\"error\", \"None\")}')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```
